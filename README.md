ClusterDFS: Experimental Distributed Storage System

This project aims to create an experimental distributed storage system in python to allow fast and efficient coding
operations over the stored data.

Features:
 * async network library based in gevent.
 * network buffers are can be easily converted to numpy arrays for efficient manipulation.
 * wrappers to allow jerasure to work directly with numpy arrays.
